    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you play around with different color settings (+backdrop type, +water settings).

This only applies to the current room. Moving to a new room will reset everything back to default.

If any colors don't seem to be working, make sure to set an alpha value greater than zero.

The controls support clicking and dragging. You can also double-click to enter a number with your keyboard.</description>
